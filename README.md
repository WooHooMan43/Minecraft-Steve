# Minecraft Steve

## What does it do?

Minecraft Steve is a Discord Bot that can help manage a Discord Server or retrieve information on a Minecraft Server.

## Who made this?

Just me as of now.

## Why did you make this?

Well it's simple. I wanted a neat Discord bot that could check the status of my Minecraft Server and manage basic parts of my Discord server.

## Commands

- `status [address?]`  
  Displays information about a Minecraft server.
  - `[address]` Gets information from a specific address instead of the address set by the server.
- `bank`
  - `bank view`  
    View the wallet and the bank.
  - `bank transfer [amount] [user]`  
    Deposit from the wallet into the bank.

## Administrator Commands

- `clear [number]`  
  Deletes a certain number preceding messages.
- `config [address?]`  
  View or change the current settings
  - `[address]` Change the server `status` retrieves information from.
- `currency [name?] [symbol?] [increment]?`  
  View or change the current currency settings.
  - `[name]` Change the currency's name.
  - `[symbol]` Change the currency's symbol.
  - `[increment]` Change the amount of currenchy awarded for each message.

## How do I add it to my server?

Here is a little forewarning before you add this bot. This bot is **rather buggy** and can crash for a number of reasons at any given moment. The bot might not also be fixed for hours at a time (school, sleep, etc.), but I will get to it as soon as I can (and when I notice). Thank you for your patience with this bot.
