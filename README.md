 A discord bot that relays information about a minecraft server and gives points to members for activity.

Why did I make this?
 Well it's simple. I wanted a neat Discord bot that could check the status of my Minecraft Server and manage basic parts of my Discord server.

What does it do?
 Precisely as stated in the above 2 statements.

How do I use it?
 There are a plethora of commands for both server members and administrators, all of which begin with '!'.
 The most basic command is '!help'. This displays an embed to the channel the command was sent in containing information on most member-friendly commands.
 Then there is the '!points' command which displays your points. Admins also have access to the 'help', 'add', 'remove', 'reset', and 'user' commands.
 Third is the '!status' command. This command simply gets information from the set Minecraft Server, letting members know if the server is online, the server's version, and the number of online players.
 Next is the '!poll' command. This command is Admin-only, so members dont go around spamming polls. The title of the poll, the number of options, and the options themselves can all be set while the bot takes care of the rest.
 Finally, the '!config' command. This is another Admin-only command with subcommands 'help', which displays a help message; 'server', which sets the Minecraft server that information is obtained from; 'adminroles', which sets the roles which have access to the Admin commands; and 'userexceptions', which sets which specific members that can access Admin-only commands.

Who made this?
 Just me.

How do I add it to my server?
 You kinda can't. I haven't made the bot public yet (nor have I made this repo public), so its inaccessable for anyone but me. However, you can ask me and I will likely add it to your server (just be aware that the bot will be up and down due to the bot running off a raspberry pi in my basement).
